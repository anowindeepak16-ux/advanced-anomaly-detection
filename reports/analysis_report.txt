Conclusion

Both One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest achieved identical ROC-AUC scores, indicating comparable anomaly detection performance on the synthetic dataset. While Isolation Forest required less feature scaling and parameter sensitivity, One-Class SVM performed equally well when properly tuned. The choice between the two models may therefore depend on computational efficiency and ease of deployment rather than detection accuracy.

# advanced-anomaly-detection
This project detects rare anomalies in high-dimensional data using unsupervised learning. A synthetic dataset with 1000 samples and 20 features is created with less than 1% anomalies. One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest models are implemented, optimized, and evaluated using ROC-AUC, with ROC curves used for performance comparison.
